					<h2>My Dose of Who?</h2>
					<p>I found this Podcast a few years ago and love its content and Garry and Adam's banter. I have watched Who since 1973 and been a fan since PDs in 1982.</p>
					<p>This is my interaction ( mute ) with other fans and I really miss it when its off air.</p>
					<p>Keep up the great work.</p>

					<h2>Vastly superior</h2>
					<p>Easily the best DW podcast going. They dissect stories/performances without making it boring.</p>
					<p>Independent podcasts tend to risk becoming about the participants rather than the topic but this one doesn't fall victim to this.</p>
					<p>Good structure, very interactive on social media and respectful of listeners opinions.</p>

					<h2>A great adventure through time and space</h2>
					<p>A stellar podcast from 2 great hosts in Garry and Adam. You can tell these guys are absolutely passionate about what they do and it's great to see. They give you the run down of this week's news to merch, then a review episode from Classic to New Who, as well as reviews on epsidodes from spin offs such as The Sarah Jane Adventures and Torchwood. A must for any Doctor Who fan.</p>

					<h2>Love it</h2>
					<p>I love listening to Adam and Garry, definitely my favourite Doctor Who podcast. I cam to the party quite late, so I'm working my way through the back catalogue, this means I'm watching stories that I wouldn't normally choose to watch and I'm really enjoying them - which is fantastic. Thanks lads keep up the good work.</p>

					<h2>Great Show for New or Old Who Fans</h2>
					<p>Since discovering this podcast I have been hooked! The hosts approach even the more lacking episodes of Who (eg. Nightmare in Silver) with a warmth and enthusiasm that is a joy to listen to, always looking to find positives. The Merch corner segment is particularly enjoyable as it is a treat to listen to honest and constructive critiques of the wide range of Doctor Who merchandise that is out there. Keep up the good work!</p>

					<h2>BEST PODCAST IN THE WHONIVERSE!</h2>
					<p>This is my all time favourite podcast, I look forward to my weekly 'Friday Fix' of Garry & Adam reviewing New Who, Classic Who & more recently the addition of Sarah Jane Adventures & Torchwood - they give honest, detailed reviews, & including fan reviews is a key part of every episode. Keep up the good work guys, you always start off my weekend on a positive note! üëù</p>
